# NavCog-Miraikan Wiki Pictures

The screenshots taken from NavCogMiraikan app and the pictures edited for Wiki and other documents

## Picture format

**.PNG**: The original screenshot for current usage and any further modification.
**.JPG**: Edited pictures for Wiki usage. Any other related documents might also use the files.

## Folders

Currently, the pictures are divided by the [Miraikan UI](https://github.com/miraikan-research/NavCog-Miraikan/wiki/Miraikan#home) sections

Those names are converted to snake_cases: e.g. `Miraikan Today` -> `miraikan_today` for easier URL access.
